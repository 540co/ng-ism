# ng-ism

This library was designed to help increase the integrity of portion marking in Angular projects.

## Features
#### Automatic Portion Marking
Just provide the text, classification, and any dissemination controls and the library will properly portion mark the section of text.

#### Leak Detection
Ng-ism does a quick check on the text provided to ensure there isn't anything included that might supercede the provided portion marking.  If it finds something, it will blur the text until the user acknowledges a warning. 
> To use this feature set the `warn` input to true.

#### Translation
Security marking can be hard to understand.  Ng-ism helps by providing translations on many popular abbreviations in security markings.  Users can see 
these translations by hovering over the portion markings. (Uses native HTML tooltips)
